# Job_Satissfaction_Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world HR dataset to uncover trends and insights about employee job satisfaction. The analysis covers various factors such as gender, job roles, salary, work-life balance, career switching, and more, using graphical and statistical techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform in-depth analysis of job satisfaction among employees by examining demographic, professional, and personal factors. The project aims to provide data-driven recommendations to organizations and individuals for improving workplace satisfaction and retention.

## Key Metrics and Insights

- Analyzed **10,000+ employee records** to derive trends in job satisfaction.
- Calculated and compared mean, median, and mode for "Happiness" metrics across genders and job titles.
- Assessed the impact of salary, work-life balance, education level, and career switching on satisfaction.
- Visualized gender distributions, job roles, salary ranges, and programming language popularity.
- Built statistical and visual models to uncover hidden patterns and correlations.

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Exploratory Data Inspection
- Loaded dataset, inspected initial rows, and checked for missing values.
- Evaluated and renamed columns for clarity.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Computed key statistics (mean, median, mode) for "Happiness" columns.
- Segmented statistics by gender and compared results.
- Grouped data by job title and country to highlight satisfaction differences.

### 3. Univariate Analysis (Graphical & Non-Graphical)
- Bar and pie charts for job title and gender distributions.
- Stacked bar charts for top programming languages by gender.

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Box plots for salary satisfaction by gender.
- Scatter plots correlating work-life balance and salary satisfaction.
- Grouped bar charts comparing salary distributions across countries and genders.

### 5. Open-Ended Analysis
- Investigated factors influencing job priorities with visualizations.
- Explored career switching trends and their impact on satisfaction.
- Analyzed the relationship between difficulty breaking into the field and happiness metrics.

### 6. Advanced Questions
- Age distribution by gender (histograms, box plots).
- Education level trends across genders (bar charts).
- Favorite programming language preferences by gender.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Data visualization** libraries for insightful graphics

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jagadeeshwari1/Job_Satissfaction_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) and run the analysis cells sequentially.

## Findings Summary

- Discovered gender-based and country-based trends in job satisfaction and salary.
- Identified that work-life balance and competitive salary are top contributors to job satisfaction.
- Career switchers often report unique satisfaction trends compared to non-switchers.
- Educational qualifications and age show notable distributions across genders.
- Programming language preferences vary significantly by gender and job title.
